### Physics-informed neural networks: A deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving nonlinear partial differential equations
by authors M. Raissi, P. Perdikaris, G.E. Karniadakis

To run the code
1. Download the data file 'cylinder_nektar_wake.mat'
2. Download the pre-trained models 'trained-navier-stokes.hdf5' and 'trained-navier-stokes_bad.hdf5'
3. Open notebook 'NavierStokeExample.ipynb' in Colab
4. Upload the data file and pre-trained models to Colab (on the left side under Files, click the 'Upload to Session Storage' button and upload both files) 
5. Specify the mode (test or train) 
6. Run notebook 

Tips:
- If you are having trouble getting the code to run or uploading data files in Google Colab, try a different browser! Chrome worked better than firefox.
